## @kluless

- i am kluless.
- i am using my phone to edit this lol. 
- i am a marine scientist. (think: corals, ecology, a little bit of fisheries, etc.)
- i taught myself ml -- marine science needs to accelerate.
- i learn everyday.

### @Ê∞¥.acc

- i am accelerating the field with Ê∞¥/acc -- the ethos of e/acc in the science of water, stuff in and around it.
- i bridge ai with the science, to accelerate the science, so decisions can be made faster.
- i believe this science favours a frequentist approach, and not much of a bayesian one. priors matter, but no guess work.
- i am building TensorTide. 
- i have built FishTally -- an AI fish counter with a counter feature. 
- i do not aim to displace marine scientists; as much as i joke about doing that, i want to build tools that serve the greater good and help in doing accelerated good.

### @oranj.üçä

- i am building oranj -- the infrastructure for digital assets.
- i believe all physical assets will need a digital version, a digital asset. 
- i aim to solve this with the help of internet computer protocol and bitcoin. 
- i am building software that will be ubiquitous for decades and immutable for centuries.

### @misc.info

- i am really into Oasis right now, possibly because of the rick & morty episode. 
- i code in python, i can replicate in julia, i think R is horrible, i am not intimidated by statistics, i am learnjng rust, elixir and javascript, with html and css as a consequence.
- i have worked with yolo models but also with TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. 
- i have completed a bunch of Coursera courses and plan to do more soon. 
- i love my casio f-91w.
- i am learning and want to get better at generative code art -- vanilla js.
